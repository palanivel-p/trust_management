                <p>6.1 Users who have registered to undertake transactions on one or more areas of our website must at all times safeguard their personal login details (e.g. user id, passwords, login and access codes and PIN numbers). For example, such users should ensure that third parties do not overlook them when logging on to transact any business. Such users must not disclose their login details to any other person nor with multiple users on a network except as may be expressly permitted pursuant to the terms of use applicable to the transactions for which the user has registered.
                    Responsibility for the security of all your login details rests with you</p>
                <p>6.2 If you are registered as described in paragraph 6.1, it is important you understand that you are responsible for the accuracy and genuineness of all instructions and information sent to us, from login to log-off. This means that you must ensure that all instructions and information are carefully checked before being sent to us.  It is also important that you read the information provided on the transactional web pages that you are registered to use. That information explains the fees and charges payable for the transactions concerned, any deductions that will or may be applied and the circumstances in which funds you send may not be applied as you have instructed.</p>
                <p>6.3 This site is as secure we can make it by using encryption technology and adopting security and anti-virus practices routinely used and adopted as a matter of good practice by other financial services businesses in the India.

ANNAI TERESA FOUNDATION will do all it reasonably can to protect this site and all internet communications passing between ANNAI TERESA FOUNDATION and users, but it cannot be held responsible for any losses fairly attributable to a user's failure to take its own reasonable precautions to prevent interception of or interference with any such communications (including, without limitation) failure to use and keep up to date firewalls and anti-virus software on the user's own computers or computer systems.</p>
